Design a HTML document to display the following and write a Java Servlet Program that represents a pseudo NJIT registration web application where students can perform two tasks :
1) search for courses and 2) register in courses. 
This is achieved through interaction with database.   
Following are minimum requirements:You will develop a client side and a Servlet program that will work with a database.
1.   The client (front end) should have a title “NJIT Registration System” and display a welcome message “Welcome to course registration site of NJIT”.
2.   It will also display two radio buttons 1) ‘Course search’ and 2) ‘Course registration’. 
3.   When you click on the radio button ‘Course search’ the following appears on the webpage:  
    A.  A drop down list box with label “Semester” and a submit button “Submit”.
    B.  The drop down list box will show ‘select semester’ by default. 
    C.  When you click open the drop down list box it will have two more items “Fall2021” and “Spring2022”. Students should be able to select either. 
    D.  After selecting semester “Fall2021”, student clicks on the “Submit” button. 
    It will send a query to the database and return a result that you will display on the webpage as follows: 
    
    CS670  Fall2021  Artificial Intelligence
    CS677  Fall2021  Deep Learning
    
    E.   After selecting semester “Spring2022”, student clicks on the “Submit” button. It will send a query to the database and return a result that you will display on the webpage as follows:

    CS675  Spring2022  Machine Learning
    CS680  Spring2022  Linux Programming   

This presentation of data can be done in one of the two ways :
I.Like its shown here – a message format.
II.Tabular format (in a table). 

4.   When you click on the radio button “Course registration”, following appears on the webpage:
    A.  A text box “CourseID”, a text box “Semester” and a button “Register”. 
    B.  Student will enter a CourseID, a semester and click on the button “Register”. This will send a query to the database which will have two possible outcome:
        I.If the query finds a match, display a message on the client like “You are registered in Artificial Intelligence for Fall 2021”. 
        II.If the query doesn’t find a match, display a message on the client “The course is not offered”. 
       
       Handle the following errors with an appropriate message displayed on the webpage:
        1.   On ‘Course Search’ option, when a student do not select Semester as “Fall2021” or “Spring2022” and click on the “Submit” button. This will send a query to the database which will not return anything. Do not code to check on the client. Let the query fail and that failure should reflect on the client. 
        2.   On “Course Registration’ option, when a student do not have input on ‘CourseID’ field and/or ‘Semester’ field and clicks on “Register”. This will send a query to the database which will not return anything. Do not code to check on the client. Let the query fail and that failure should reflect on the client. 
        3.   There can be other error situations too but this much is good enough for the test. 
        
        Database info:
        1.   Create a database “NJIT”.
        2.   Create a table “Courses” in that database. 
        The database should have only the required data as displayed on section 3D and 3E. Those four rows of data should be good enough.
