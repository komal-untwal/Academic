City Library

USER GUIDE:

This document elucidates the requirements, specifications and features of City Library System which aims to assist readers in managing their preferred library works such as books, journals, etc. in order to have them available for the purpose of reading (both online and offline), safekeeping of the literary works and sharing the resources so as to pave the way for the database to grow as the number of users increases.
The file paths of all literary works available on this system are stored in the databases while the actual files are stored in system folders and they are available in pdf format. The library records information about all documents that are available in its system. Each document is identified by a unique number (DocumentId) It also has a title, a publisher, a publication date, and can be one of three different types: book, journal volume, or conference proceedings.
For each document type I have stored additional information. For instance, for books we need to record their ISBN, and for conference proceedings we need to record the date and location of the conference, and the proceedings chair. A journal volume has a number and can have several issues (up to 10). A journal issue has a number (1, 2, 3..) that uniquely identifies the journal issues of the same journal volume. A journal has a single chief editor who usually lasts for many years and supervises many consecutive journal volumes. Chief editors are identified by their ID and their name has to be recorded. Journal issues might have one or more guest editors and a scope that need to be recorded. The library system contains several branches, which are identified by a number (BID). We also need to store the name and the location of each branch. Each branch of the library holds a number of copies of a particular document. Each copy of the same document kept by the same library branch is numbered from 1 to n. The total number of copies of each document in the library is needed .This system has been implemented and developed in JAVA language and MySQL has been used to create and manage databases.
The system is organized into two realms: Readers and administrator. The users are required to first register themselves by providing valid details to the administrator and the administrator only has the permission to add a new reader, the administrator logs the user in the system and permits users to maintain and manage their profile. Readers are granted access to all the resources entitled to them. They may search for a specific book or search a document by ID, title, or publisher name. They can check the document checkout, document return and document reserve. The reader can compute fine for a document copy borrowed by a reader based on the current date. He can also print the list of documents reserved by a reader and their status. He can also print the document id and document titles of documents published by a publisher.
